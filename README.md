## What is this?

**nextendo-nex** is the server core that powers the [Nextendo Network](https://nextendo.network)
game servers: Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, Splatoon 2, Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, and others.

NEX is the client-server middleware many Nintendo games use for matchmaking, rankings, and other
online services, layered on top of the PRUDP transport. This package reimplements the **server side**
of that stack from scratch:

- **PRUDP** transport (reliable UDP: connection handshake, fragmentation, acknowledgements)
- **RMC** message layer (the request/response format NEX methods speak)
- **Kerberos-style** ticket authentication (auth server ↔ secure server)
- The **common service protocols** games build on (matchmaking, ranking, data store, utility, …)

It has **no third-party NEX dependencies**, only permissive Go libraries (`gorilla/websocket`,
`lxzan/gws`). The module is `github.com/NextendoNetwork/nextendo-nex`.

## Usage

This is a library, not a runnable server on its own. A game server imports it, registers the
protocols and methods that game needs, and starts an endpoint. See the per-game repositories for
concrete servers built on top of this core.

```go
import nex "github.com/NextendoNetwork/nextendo-nex"
```

## What this is not

This project ships **no** Nintendo code, keys, or copyrighted assets. It is an independent,
clean-room reimplementation of a publicly-documented protocol, for use with a community-run
replacement service. It is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or associated with Nintendo.

## Credits

- The NEX / PRUDP protocol is publicly documented by
  [Kinnay's NintendoClients](https://github.com/kinnay/NintendoClients) (MIT); this implementation
  follows that documentation.
