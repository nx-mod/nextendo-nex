// natbridge: hands a joiner the host's REAL UDP endpoint at GetSessionURLs.
//
// Why this exists. Pia probes the nncs NAT-check responder AFTER it has registered its
// station URL, and what it registers is its WebSocket TCP port — useless for a UDP
// hole-punch. So the URLs a host reports are, for P2P purposes, wrong. The nncs responder
// is the only component that ever observes the client's real external UDP endpoint; it
// writes each one to a file, and this reads it back so the session URLs point somewhere a
// probe can actually reach.
//
// Without it the joiner gets the TCP port, the probe never lands, and the console gives
// up: it stops after MatchMakingExt m=1 and re-registers in a loop until the game shows a
// connection error. That is the exact shape of the MK8 worldwide failure, and it is why
// worldwide broke when MK8 moved to this core — the the previous stack stack had this bridge
//, and it was not ported.
//
// The file is written by the nncs responder co-located with the game server
// (NNCS_NAT_FILE). It MUST be local: a responder on another host cannot share it.

// bridgeStatus says whether the bridge ran, and if not, whether waiting could help.
// The distinction matters: GetSessionURLs is on the join path, so a caller must only
// stall for a shortfall that a moment will actually fix.
